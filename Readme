After completing this chapter, I will be able to：
    1、Understand the parameters of simple illumination models
    2、Define infrastructure supports for working with multiple light sources
    3、Understand the basics of diffuse reflection and normal mapping
    4、Understand the basics of specular reflection and the Phong illumination model
    5、Implement GLSL shaders to simulate diffuse and specular reflection and the Phong
    6、Create and manipulate point, directional, and spotlights
    7、Simulate shadows with the WebGL stencil buffer
